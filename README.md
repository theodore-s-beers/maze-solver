# maze-solver

This program generates a 12x12 grid of cells, randomly opens up a path from the
top left cell to the bottom right, and then finds that path via depth-first
search. The graphical interface is provided by
[Tk](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_(software)>).

Assuming that you have a recent version of Python 3 installed (I used 3.9), and
that it came bundled with the
[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) package, running this
program should be as simple as running `python3 maze.py`.
